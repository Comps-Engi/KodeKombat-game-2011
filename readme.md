KodeKombat Game 2011
====================
The game for 2011 is PacMan. Each side has a pacman and 4 ghosts each. And they
compete against each other to keep their pacman alive and get the maximum number
of pellets.
The game ends when:
1. Either of the pacmen is eaten by a monster.
2. All the pellets have been eaten by the pacmen.
3. Number of moves is 10*height*width of the arena.

This project has the game and a viewer in WebGL, to be used in the website.
