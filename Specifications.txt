GAME STATE

The game state can be a 2D array i.e a matrix similar to the map matrix.the position of G,P will get updated after each move.
Along with this there are two flags,one for each player (f1 and f2)
to indicate whether the ghosts are active or passive. These flags will be updated when the other players pacman eats a power pellet

Filenames
The game state will be saved in a file named state.txt
The bots will read the file and save the next move onto file move.txt in current folder. The bots will be different folders.
The game trace will be saved onto trace.txt


GAME TRACE FORMAT

initial position is taken from the map MAP
For each turn, the co-ordinates of Gs and P is given, followed by the current score of both players and state of the flags
xg11 yg11 xg12 yg12 xg13 yg13 xg14 yg14 xp1 yp1 xg21 yg21 xg22 yg22 xg23 yg23 xg24 yg24 xp2 yp2 s1 s2 f1 f2

Processing the game trace
-------------------------
The previous positions are written with a '.'
If the new and old coordinates are same do nothing.
If the new position of ghost coincides  with the new/current position of G, then do nothing
If the new position of pacman coincides with the new/current position of G and if f is set, then pacman eats ghost.
If the new position of pacman coincides with the new/current position of G and if f is not set, then game ends.
